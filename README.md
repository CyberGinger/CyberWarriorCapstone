# CyberWarriorCapstone
Hello, 
This is our final Cyber Warrior Captsone project. The team: Joel Taylor, Joseph Larkin , & Maureen Kennedy. Our task was to act as hired penetration testers for Bbank. Bbank is a ficticious bank with web services used for clients to log in to their profile.
Our goal was to perform a grey box vulnerability scan of BBank customer portal. We then use this information to potentially gain access to the system to exploit various vulnerabilities that we come across.
Afterwards we provided our findings and recommendations to strengthen and remediate any potential security flaws.
